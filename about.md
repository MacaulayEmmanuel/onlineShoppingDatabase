About the Online Shopping Website Database Project:

This project involved designing and implementing a relational database for an online shopping website that allows users to browse and purchase products. The database stores information about the products, orders, and customers, and is intended to support the website's e-commerce functionality.

As part of this project, I created a database schema consisting of four tables, with appropriate relationships between them. I also wrote SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, including retrieving all products with their prices and descriptions, calculating the total revenue generated by the online store, and updating and deleting data as necessary.

In addition, I created views for frequently used queries, such as the total revenue and the top-selling products.

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a functional database system for a specific use case, as well as my proficiency in SQL and database management.
